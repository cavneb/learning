The Strategy pattern is a delegation-based approach to solving the same problem as the Template Method pattern. Instead of teasing out the variable parts of your algo- rithm and pushing them down into subclasses, you simply implement each version of your algorithm as a separate object. You can then vary the algorithm by supplying dif- ferent strategy objects to the contextâ€”one strategy for producing HTML and a dif- ferent one for outputting PDF files, for example, or perhaps one strategy for calculating Virginia taxes and a different one for computing Pennsylvania taxes.
