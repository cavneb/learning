In Scrabble parlance, a bingo is a play where one gets rid of all seven letters. A bingo stem is a set of six letters that combine with another letter of the alphabet to make a seven-letter word. Some six-letter stems have more possible combinations than others. For instance, one of the more prolific stems, SATIRE, combines with twenty letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, V, and W to form words such as ASTERIA, BAITERS, RACIEST, and so on.

Write a program that, given a word list and a cutoff n, finds all six-letter stems that combine with n or more distinct letters, sorted by greatest number of combinations to least.

If you need a word list to help in developing a solution, you can find Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL) online.
