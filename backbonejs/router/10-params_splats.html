<h1>Dynamic Routing - ":params" and "*splats"</h1>

<p>Backbone uses two styles of variables when implementing routes. First there are ':params' which match any URL components between slashes. Then there are '*splats' which match any number of URL components. Note that due to the nature of a '*splat' it will always be the last variable in your URL as it will match any and all components.</p>

<p>Any '*splats' or ':params' in route definitions are passed as variables respective order to the associated function. A route defined as '/:route/:action' will pass 2 variables(route, action) to the call back function. Which can be accessed with 'function( route, action )'. (If this is confusing please post a comment and I will try articulate it better)</p>

<p>Routes are quite powerful and in an ideal world your application should never contain too many. If you need to implement hash tags with SEO in mind, do a google search for 'google seo hashbangs'.</p>
