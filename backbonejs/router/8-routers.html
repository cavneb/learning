<h1>Routers</h1>

<p>Backbone routers are used for routing your applications URL's when using hash tags(#). In the traditional MVC sense they don't neccesarily fit the semantics and if you have read "What is a view?" it will elaborate on this point. Though a Backbone "router" is still very useful for any application/feature that needs URL routing/history capabilities.</p>

<p>Defined routers should always contain at least one route and a function to map the particular route to. In the example below we are going to define a route that is always called.</p>

<p>Also note that routes intepret anything after "#" tag in the url. All links in your application should target "#/action" or "#action". (Appending a forward slash after the hashtag looks a bit nicer e.g. http://example.com/#/user/help)</p>

<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

  var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
      "*actions": "defaultRoute" // matches http://example.com/#anything-here
    },
    defaultRoute: function( actions ){
      // The variable passed in matches the variable in the route definition "actions"
      alert( actions );
    }
  });
  
  // Initialize the router
  var app_router = new AppRouter;
  
  // Start Backbone History a necessary step for bookmarkable URL's
  Backbone.history.start();
  
</script>

<a href="#action">Activate route</a>
<a href="#/route/action">Activate another route</a>

<p>** Notice the change in the url **</p>
