localStorage
============

Stores data in key/value pairs, tied to a domain, and persists across browser sessions.

The localStorage mechanism provides a very simple method for developers to persist data on the client's machine. The localStorage mechanism is simply a name/value store built In to the web browser.

Information stored In localStorage persists between browser sessions and can't be read by other websites, because it's restricted to the domain you're currently visiting.
